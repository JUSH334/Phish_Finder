This file is large because it is the training dataset. It is just a bunch of links essentially.
I have a link to a google drive with the zip file because it is too large to place in github.

Below is the link to where I got the dataset:

https://huggingface.co/datasets/ealvaradob/phishing-dataset

What I've done is used chatgpt to ask it questions and help with code. I used CoLab to process
the "combined dataset" because it runs faster on there than a local pc/desktop

Just need to implement/"train" the datasets in the link above.
